* Project Overview: Student Grade Calculator

This project involves developing a Python program that calculates the final grades of students based on their scores in various subjects or assignments. The program is designed to streamline the grade calculation process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

* Key Features:

1. Input Handling:
   - The program accepts input for scores obtained by students in different subjects or assignments.
   - It also takes into account the weightage of each subject or assignment, allowing for flexible grade calculations.

2. Grade Calculation:
   - The program computes the weighted average of the scores based on the provided weightage.
   - It calculates the total score for each student by summing up the weighted scores.

4. Grading Scale:
   - The program uses a predefined grading scale to determine the final grade based on the total score.
   - The grading scale can be customized to fit different grading systems.

5. Output:
   - The final grades are displayed in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for students and educators to understand.

*Usage:

- Users input the scores and weightage for each subject or assignment.
- The program calculates the weighted average and total score.
- Based on the total score, the program assigns a final grade according to the grading scale.
- The final grade is then displayed for each student.

*Benefits:

- Efficiency: Automates the grade calculation process, saving time and effort.
- Accuracy: Ensures precise calculations, reducing the possibility of errors.
- Flexibility: Adapts to different grading systems and weightage criteria.

This project serves as a valuable tool for educators and students, simplifying the process of grade calculation and providing accurate results.
