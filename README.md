* Project Overview: Student Grade Calculator

This project involves developing a Python program that calculates the final grades of students based on their scores in various subjects or assignments. The program is designed to streamline the grade calculation process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

1. Purpose:

The program calculates the grade of a student based on their scores.
It uses functions to perform operations like summing scores and calculating averages.
It allows the user to exit the program by entering 'x'.

2. Features:

Input Handling: Continuously accepts scores until the user decides to exit.
Functions:
sum_scores(scores): Calculates the sum of scores entered.
calculate_average(scores): Computes the average of scores entered.
Grade Calculation: Determines the grade based on the average score obtained.
User Interaction: Provides a simple command-line interface for input and output.

3. Program Flow:

Initialization:

Initialize an empty list to store scores.
Input Loop:
Prompt the user to enter scores one by one.
Check if the user wants to exit (by entering 'x').
Add each score to the list until the user exits.

Calculations:
Use the sum_scores function to compute the total sum of scores.
Use the calculate_average function to determine the average score.

Grade Determination:
Based on the average score, decide and display the corresponding grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).

Output:
Display the total sum, average score, and final grade to the user.

4. Example Workflow:

User starts the program.
Enters scores (e.g., 85, 90, 78).
Decides to exit by typing 'x'.
Program calculates the sum of scores, average score, and determines the grade.
Outputs the results to the user.

Conclusion:

This Python program calculates student grades based on input scores. It uses functions for summing scores, calculating averages, and determining grades. The program allows continuous score entry until the user exits with 'x'. It provides a basic yet effective demonstration of input handling, function usage, and simple output formatting in Python.
